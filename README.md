# Keylogger

This is the Keylogger that I had created as a part of completing [Build an Advanced Keylogger using C++ for Ethical Hacking!](Build an Advanced Keylogger using C++ for Ethical Hacking!)

This keylogger is capable of recording all the keyboard and mouse input! It can even record independent of the language settings because it logs the physical keys on the keyboard first. Next, by using an arbitrary keymap with human friendly names, it translates the machine keys to something that we can understand. It also possesses mail sending capabilities so you can just schedule the logfile to be sent via mail, lets say every 12 hours. In addition to this, it will also keep the logfile encrypted.

This is only for educational purposes.
